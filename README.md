#		BINARY TREES
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children referred to as the *left child* and the *right child*.

#		BINARY SEARCH TREE
Also we have a *binary search tree* (BST) which can also be referred to as *ordered or sorted binary tree*. It is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones on its right subtree.
	
Time complexity in big O notation
*Operation	Average		Worst case*
Search		O(log n)	   O(n)
Insert		O(log n)	   O(n)
Delete		O(log n)	   O(n)
		
	*Space complexity
Space		O(n)		   O(n)
